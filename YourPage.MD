#### Prompt

What's interesting about you? Imagine they'd like to know what's interesting about you before they hire you. What would you include: a brief bio, a bunch of photos, links to other sites where you can see more of them?

**Directions**: Your task is to build a website or your page with enough content to convince anyone that you are  worth knowing about.

Include the following sections each wrapped in a `div` with an appropriate ID name:

* "Intro" or "Header" section with:
  * The person's name
  * catch phrase or quote
  * A picture
* "About Me" section
  * that describes what they're known for.
* An "Achievements", "Last Seen", or similar section.
  * This should include at least 3 nested `div`'s that each contain a title, picture, and an optional description for context.
  * This could be movie appearances, popular events, achievements or awards, or fictional locations that you've made an appearance at.
* An "Other" section
  * This should include other websites you can go to to find your work or impact on the world.(it can be google.com)

#### Extensions

**Directions**:

* Turn your achievements section into a table with a title, date, picture, and description.
* You may have noticed that some your page is already styled with colors. Add IDs and class names where appropriate and see if you can fiddle with the colors on your page. Use the example lab to help you.

**Reflection Questions:**

* What are some things you would do to make this website prettier if you could and had more time? You may want to look online for some inspiration.
