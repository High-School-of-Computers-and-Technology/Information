### Defeating LittyTron

Today, we're exploring an important programming concept related to errors, specifically logic errors. To illustrate this, let’s consider an AI named LittyTron. We want LittyTron to be somewhat beatable, but with a catch: we also want to make it challenging enough for fifth graders to win, as long as they think strategically.

Now, imagine we’re building a Tic Tac Toe app for those fifth graders. Ideally, they'd have a chance to beat LittyTron, but because we mistakenly assume LittyTron should be unbeatable, we inadvertently make the game frustrating and discourage the players from continuing. This unintended outcome, where our code doesn't behave as expected due to incorrect assumptions, is an example of a logic error.

We will engage in some code exploration which will expand our code reading ability to understand the incorrect logic. Once we've obtained an adequate logic understanding, we will modify it in a way that LittyTron can indeed be playable with fifth graders.

Let's start by forking the LittyTron webapp [LittyTron webapp ](https://codepen.io/jamilton08/pen/dPbNPXz). Try to defeat him.

### Assigned Task
***Directions***
you may work in groups and use many resources available to figure out LittyTron. Think back to data structures and google code that you don't understand.

***Answer Questions Below***
* What ranges of lines define which move LittyTron is making ?
* What logic is LittyTron using to make his moves ?
* Did you play LittyTron, if you did did you discover anything during your battles ? 
* How is "Game Over" determined?
* Take two functions from the script and describe them briefly and what they do ?
* Was there another way that I could use the "winCombo" constant to determine victory (another structure) ? 
* Based on the script, is LittyTron's next move predictable, if yes. Why?


### **Grading Rubric for LittyTron Analysis**

---

#### **1. What ranges of lines define which move LittyTron is making? (15 points)**

**Full Credit (15 points):**  
- You correctly identify the line ranges that correspond to the logic for making moves.  
- You describe the relevant functions, variables, or conditionals that determine LittyTron's moves.

**Partial Credit (7-14 points):**  
- You identify part of the relevant line range or make an incomplete connection to the move logic.

**No Credit (0-6 points):**  
- You fail to provide a correct or relevant response to this question.

---

#### **2. What logic is LittyTron using to make his moves? (20 points)**

**Full Credit (20 points):**  
- You provide a clear, detailed explanation of the logic LittyTron uses, such as pattern recognition, random choice, or strategic decision-making.  
- Mention of any variables, algorithms, or decision trees that LittyTron might be using is included.

**Partial Credit (10-19 points):**  
- You describe some aspects of LittyTron’s decision-making but leave out key details or don’t fully explain the logic behind the moves.

**No Credit (0-9 points):**  
- You fail to accurately describe LittyTron’s logic or provide incorrect/incomplete information.

---

#### **3. Did you play LittyTron? If you did, did you discover anything during your battles? (10 points)**

**Full Credit (10 points):**  
- You confirm whether you played against LittyTron and describe any insights, patterns, or flaws you noticed in its behavior.  
- If you didn't play, you explain why or how you would approach testing LittyTron.

**Partial Credit (5-9 points):**  
- You confirm you played but don’t provide much insight or detail into your experience with LittyTron’s behavior.  
- If you didn’t play, you offer limited reasoning or hypothesis.

**No Credit (0-4 points):**  
- You fail to answer the question or offer vague, unhelpful responses.

---

#### **4. How is "Game Over" determined? (10 points)**

**Full Credit (10 points):**  
- You provide a clear and accurate explanation of how the "Game Over" condition is triggered, referencing the relevant function or conditions.

**Partial Credit (5-9 points):**  
- You describe part of the "Game Over" condition but miss some key details.

**No Credit (0-4 points):**  
- You fail to answer or provide an incorrect answer.

---

#### **5. Take two functions from the script and describe them briefly and what they do. (15 points)**

**Full Credit (15 points):**  
- You select two functions from the script and describe their purpose, input, and output clearly.  
- You also include any significant interactions between these functions and the rest of the program.

**Partial Credit (7-14 points):**  
- You describe the functions but miss some important aspects, such as purpose or full functionality.

**No Credit (0-6 points):**  
- You either fail to describe the functions correctly or choose irrelevant functions.

---

#### **6. Was there another way that I could use the "winCombo" constant to determine victory (another structure)? (10 points)**

**Full Credit (10 points):**  
- You suggest an alternative structure or method to use the "winCombo" constant, explaining how it could improve or change the way victory is determined.

**Partial Credit (5-9 points):**  
- You provide an alternative but don't explain how it would work or how it would differ from the original structure.

**No Credit (0-4 points):**  
- You fail to suggest a valid alternative or fail to explain the concept.

---

#### **7. Based on the script, is LittyTron's next move predictable? If yes, why? (15 points)**

**Full Credit (15 points):**  
- You provide a clear answer on whether LittyTron’s next move is predictable, giving reasoning based on the logic found in the script.  
- You back up your response with examples or patterns observed.

**Partial Credit (7-14 points):**  
- You provide some reasoning but don't fully explain why the next move is or isn’t predictable.

**No Credit (0-6 points):**  
- You fail to answer whether the next move is predictable or provide inaccurate reasoning.

---

#### **Bonus: Modify LittyTron’s Logic (20 points)**

**Full Credit (20 points):**  
- You successfully modify LittyTron’s logic so that it remains competitive while addressing the questions above.  
- Your changes enhance or tweak LittyTron’s behavior in a meaningful way without completely breaking its competitiveness.  
- Include a description or justification for the modifications.

**Partial Credit (10-19 points):**  
- You modify LittyTron’s logic but with limited improvements or without fully explaining the rationale for the changes.

**No Credit (0-9 points):**  
- You fail to make effective changes to LittyTron’s logic, or the changes don't address the issues outlined in the grading rubric.

---

### **Submission Instructions:**

- **Screenshots**: If you managed to beat LittyTron, please submit a screenshot of lines 94 to 105 showing in the background. This will help confirm your understanding of the logic.
  
- **Modifications**: If you didn’t beat LittyTron, please modify the logic in a competitive manner. Document your changes and explain how they improve the game or make it more unpredictable and paste your codepen link to the Google classroom  assignment.

---

### **Final Grade Breakdown**:

- Full marks: 100 points  
- If you submit a working screenshot, you’ll receive full marks for the tasks completed and the modifications to the logic.  
- If you don’t manage to beat LittyTron but make effective improvements, you can still score highly for the adjustments made and the quality of the responses.

Good luck!
