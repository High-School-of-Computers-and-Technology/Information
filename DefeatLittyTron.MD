### Defeating LittyTron

Today, we're exploring an important programming concept related to errors, specifically logic errors. To illustrate this, let’s consider an AI named LittyTron. We want LittyTron to be somewhat beatable, but with a catch: we also want to make it challenging enough for fifth graders to win, as long as they think strategically.

Now, imagine we’re building a Tic Tac Toe app for those fifth graders. Ideally, they'd have a chance to beat LittyTron, but because we mistakenly assume LittyTron should be unbeatable, we inadvertently make the game frustrating and discourage the players from continuing. This unintended outcome, where our code doesn't behave as expected due to incorrect assumptions, is an example of a logic error.

We will engage in some code exploration which will expand our code reading ability to understand the incorrect logic. Once we've obtained an adequate logic understanding, we will modify it in a way that LittyTron can indeed be playable with fifth graders.

Let's start by forking the LittyTron webapp [LittyTron webapp ](https://codepen.io/jamilton08/pen/dPbNPXz). Try to defeat him.
