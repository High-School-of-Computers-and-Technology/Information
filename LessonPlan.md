**Teacher:** Jonathan Cruz

**Date:** November 20th, 2023

**Course:** Computer Science: Web Design

**Topic:** Conditionals and If Statements

---

### **Level 3/4 Essential Question(s) (Hess Matrices)**  
Evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating conditional statements to enhance program interactivity and how these statements impact user engagement and program responsiveness.

---

### **CC/NextGen Standards**  
- **9-12.CT.4** Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.  
- **9-12.CT.8** Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.  
- **9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.  
- **9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.

---

### **Learning Objectives**  
Students will be able to:  
- Use an `if-then` statement.  
- Create conditional statements (event handlers).

---

### **Data Used to Inform Instruction**  
Data from the previous lesson on conditional statements shows about 60% of students struggle to understand when and how to write these statements. Hence, this extended lesson includes more practice with the `if/else` conditional and pseudocode.

### **Materials/Resources/Technology**  
- Google Classroom  
- Repl.it/P5 Editor  
- Pens/Pencils  
- Rulers  
- Worksheet (printed or digital)  
- Index Cards/Half Sheets for Exit Slip  
- Pseudocode Conditionals Worksheet

### **Procedure**

| **Time** | **Activity** | **Checks for Understanding/Hinge Pivot Points** |
|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 10 mins  | **Do Now** | Quick warm-up on basic comparisons and true/false evaluations. |
| 8 mins   | **Mini Lesson** | - Introduce conditional expressions. Examples: 26>5 (true), 10==14 (false), 4>210 (false), 2==2 (true). <br> - Use `console.log()` to verify expressions in the editor. |
| 10 mins  | **Peer Collaboration** | Students collaborate in completing pseudocode in the second column of the worksheet. |
| 20 mins  | **Individual Practice: Conditionals Off Canvas** | Students analyze and compare different codes using conditionals, running the logic in the console without using the canvas. |
| 7 mins   | **Exit Ticket** | Students evaluate conditional statements' role in programming efficiency. How do conditional statements enhance the efficiency and functionality of a program? |

### **Differentiation Strategies/Rationale for Student Groupings**

- **Tier 1:**  
  - **Clear Explanations:** Provide straightforward explanations of conditional statements.  
  - **Visual Aids:** Use flowcharts and diagrams to explain conditional logic.  
  - **Peer Collaboration:** Encourage learning from peers through collaboration.

- **Tier 2:**  
  - **Scaffolded Activities:** Break down complex conditionals into manageable parts.  
  - **Additional Practice:** Provide extra exercises for reinforcement.  
  - **Guided Exercises:** Offer support through targeted, guided exercises.

- **Tier 3:**  
  - **Individualized Instruction:** Offer one-on-one or small-group instruction to address specific challenges.  
  - **Modified Assignments:** Adjust assignments to match skill levels for better engagement.

### **Assessment**

- **Formative:**  
  - Use of conditionals during activities.  
  - End-of-lesson wrap-up discussion.

- **Summative:**  
  - **Traffic Light (Upcoming Mini Project).**  
  - **Draw App (Upcoming Lesson Final).**

---

### **Connections (Interdisciplinary/Culturally Responsive Education/Inquiry Cycles)**  
I will incorporate examples and scenarios that reflect the students' cultural backgrounds and experiences. This includes situations from various cultures or communities where conditional logic is commonly applied.
